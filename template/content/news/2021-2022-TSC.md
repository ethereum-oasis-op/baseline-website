The Baseline Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is in charge of managing conflicts on merges and Core Dev self-organization. It also governs the allocation of grant money. The TSC meets regularly to set technical roadmaps and ensure progress of the community toward the ubiquitous implementation of the baseline protocol in systems of record everywhere.

The TSC is elected once a year. The latest elections took place throughout October 2021. On 27 October, the election results were presented in the [Baseline Show](https://youtu.be/LcrTRf_JKW0?t=107). See the [current TSC members here.](https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/community/community-leaders#your-technical-steering-committee-1).
